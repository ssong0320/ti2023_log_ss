1. I have little to no experience with databases. I worked with firebase once for a login/register system but I only know what was shown through the youtube tutorial.

2. One thing I learned was the idea of foreign keys and how they allow for connections to be created between related data across different tables.

3.A database for a grocery shopping list application would include tables for users, lists, and items. Users can create shopping lists, add items with quantities, and mark items as purchased, providing an organized and efficient way to manage their grocery needs.
