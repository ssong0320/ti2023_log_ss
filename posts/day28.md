1. At first, I didn't realize that there was a difference between what server the local host was run on which caused my blog app to break. I  later was able to solve the misunderstanding and make my app run again.

2.the structure of Client/Server interested me the most. The client is a device or app makes requests and the server is a centralized system that respinds to those requests. This structure is important for full stack development because it allows for an easy way to communicate between the server and client.

3. The blog app consists of a client side interface, a server handling the logic, and a database to store data.The add blog involves the client getting user input  and sending a POST request to the server and the server inserts that information into the database through a query.
