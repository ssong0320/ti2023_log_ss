Topic: Introduction to JS

1. Week 1 went well, I was a little busy with school but luckily we did not do too much learning at cbk. I learned some of the basics of HTML and CSS as well as how to clone a git repository. I had a little trouble with cloning since I was used to doing it a different way, but I manged to get it sorted out.

2. I'd say 4~5, I know the basics of JS like the loops and functions etc, but I am not familar with coding in JS so I might struggle a bit there.

3. If statements are used when you want to have multiple options. Sometimes according to what is inputted you might have a different output, so if and else statemtns are used to keep those different answers in 1 functions so you can save yourself the effort of having to create more functions.
