1. I was super busy week 2 because I had finals coming up so it was a little hard for me to really study in-dept he javacripot that was taught this wweek,

2. ~6

3. My approach was to just make a switch with all of the possible outocmes for each choice, and to display that outcome after each choice the user makes.

4. My approach was to use a class-based approach where the operations, display updates, and event listeners are organized within the Calculator class

5. Classes are like a template and you can use these templates to create a specific instance of a class and this is a object.
