1. I have little to no experience working in full stack development. I did a porject once that uised firebase to help with login/register, but I never managed to make it be able to save the data for oarticular user.

2. Netflix probably uses full stack development becasue it would have to connect it's frontend with movies and tv shows that are in its database.
